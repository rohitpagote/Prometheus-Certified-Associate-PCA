# Pushing Metrics
We can push the metrics to a Pushgateway using two methods:
1. HTTP Request
2. Client Library

---

# Pushing Metrics via HTTP Request 
- We can push metrics by sending an HTTP POST request to a URL formatted as follows:
```ini
http://<pushgateway_address>:<port>/metrics/job/<job_name>/<label1>/<value1>/<label2>/<value2>
```
- The `pushgateway_address` and `port` specify the destination.
- The `job` segment designates the job label, with `<job_name>` indicating the associated metric's job name.
- Additional `label/value` pairs not only supplement the metrics with extra labels but also serve as a grouping key, allowing to update or delete metrics as a collection.

> [!NOTE]
> Pushing metrics via HTTP requests involves manually constructing these requests and sending them directly to the Push Gateway.

## Example: Pushing Metrics Using curl
- Here is an example where we push a metric named example_metric with a value of 4421 under the job db_backup. This is done using the curl command:
```bash
$ echo "example_metric 4421" | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/db_backup
```
- The metric data is sent as binary using `--data-binary`.
- The `echo` command outputs the metric string.
- The `@-` flag directs curl to read the binary data from standard input.
- The URL targets the local Push Gateway at port `9091`, appending the necessary job label.

- After pushing the metric, retrieve the metrics from the Push Gateway with:
```bash
$ curl localhost:9091/metrics

example_metric{instance="",job="db_backup"} 4421
# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the pause duration of garbage collection cycles.
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 1.0373e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 2.5597e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 2.7005e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 3.787e-05
```

# Grouping Metrics
- The URL path, which includes the job name and any additional label-value pairs, functions as a grouping key. 
- Metrics pushed to the same URL are part of a group, enabling bulk updates or deletion.

## Grouping Example
- Imagine we want to push two metrics - `metric_one` (counter) and `metric_two` (gauge)â€”together under a group labeled as `archive` with an additional label `db=mysql`. Use the following command:
```bash
$ cat <<EOF | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/archive/db/mysql
# TYPE metric_one counter
metric_one{label="val1"} 11
# TYPE metric_two gauge
# HELP metric_two Just an example.
metric_two 100
EOF
```
- The job is named `archive`.
- The label `db=mysql` groups these metrics.
- All metrics pushed via this URL belong to the same group.

- Changing the grouping labels creates a distinct group. 
- For instance, the following command creates a group with the label `app=web`:
```bash
$ cat <<EOF | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/archive/app/web
# TYPE metric_one counter
metric_one{label="val1"} 22
# TYPE metric_two gauge
# HELP metric_two Just an example.
metric_two 200
EOF
```
- Now, we have two groups:
    1. Group one: archive with `db=mysql`
    2. Group two: archive with `app=web`

- Verify the grouped metrics with:
```bash
$ curl localhost:9091/metrics | grep archive
metric_one{db="mysql",instance="",job="archive",label="val1"} 11
metric_two{db="mysql",instance="",job="archive"} 100


metric_one{app="web",instance="",job="archive",label="val1"} 22
metric_two{app="web",instance="",job="archive"} 200
```

# Updating Metrics: POST vs. PUT
## Using POST
- A POST request **updates only the metrics that have the same name as those in the new payload**, leaving other metrics in the group unchanged. 
- For example, to update `metric_one` in the `archive/app/web` group:
```bash
$ cat <<EOF | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/archive/app/web
# TYPE metric_one counter
metric_one{label="val1"} 44
EOF
```

## Using PUT
- A PUT request, by contrast, **replaces all metrics within the specified group with the new set provided**. 
- For instance, to completely replace the group contents with only `metric_one`:
```bash
$ cat <<EOF | curl -X PUT --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/archive/app/web
# TYPE metric_one counter
metric_one{label="val1"} 44
EOF
After this command, only metric_one exists in the archive/app/web group, and all previous metrics (e.g., metric_two) are removed.
```

---

# Deleting Metrics
- To remove all metrics from a specific group, send a DELETE request to that group's URL:
```bash
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/archive/app/web
```
- Once executed, the group `archive/app/web` is deleted, leaving other groups (like `archive/db/mysql`) unaffected.

---

# Summary
- Use a POST request to update specific metrics by name within a group.
- Use a PUT request to completely replace all metrics in a group.
- Use a DELETE request to remove all metrics belonging to a given group.
