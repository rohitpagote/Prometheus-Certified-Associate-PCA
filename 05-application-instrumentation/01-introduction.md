# Introduction - Application Instrumentation
A Prometheus **Client Libraries** provide an easy way to add **instrumentation** to our application code in order to track and expose metrics for Prometheus.
1. Track metrics in the Prometheus expected format.
2. Expose metrics via `/metrics` path.

Prometheus has official client libraries for the following languages:
- Go
- Java/Scala
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust

Unofficial third-party client libraries:
- Bash
- C
- C++
- Common Lisp
- Dart
- Elixir
- Erlang
- Haskell
- Lua
- C#
- Node.js
- Ocaml
- Perl
- PHP
- R

We can even develop our own library if the language isn't suuported or to avoid extra dependencies.
