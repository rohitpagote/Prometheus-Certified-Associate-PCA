# What is Prometheus?
- Prometheus is a **powerful, open-source monitoring solution** that **scrapes matrics from targets via HTTP endpoints**. 
- It is widely used to gather critical system and application metrics, store them in a time series database, and enable complex querying using its native language, **PromQL**.
- Additionally, Prometheus features **built-in alerting** that allows you to define rules for notifying teams when specific thresholds are exceeded.

## Types of Metrics Monitored
- Prometheus is versatile in monitoring a broad range of metrics, including:
    - System Metrics:
        - CPU utilization
        - Memory usage
        - Disk space usage
        - Service uptime
    - Application-Specific Metrics:
        - Exception counts
        - Latency measurements
        - Number of pending requests

## Data Integration
- Prometheus is built to seamlessly collect metrics from a diverse range of sourcesâ€”not just applications and operating systems but also networking devices, databases, and other critical IT infrastructure components. Its extensive integration capabilities make it a favorite among IT professionals.

## Focused on Numeric Data
- Prometheus specializes in capturing numeric time-series data. 
- It is engineered for metric collection and analysis, meaning it is not designed to monitor events, logs, or traces.

## Background and Development
- Prometheus was originally sponsored by SoundCloud but in 2016 it joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- Prometheus is primarily written GoLang.
